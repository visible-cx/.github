## Hi there 👋 We're Visible

### Who/What is Visible?
Visible is a tool to help you understand how you are seen online, and once you understand how you are seen for you to control that. It's your data after all, you should be in charge of it. 

### What are we building?
The main app we are building is Visible, currently a webapp, but will soon have mobile and desktop too. See a preview here: http://vsbl.netlify.app

We've also built some other pro-privacy tools, like our free Databroker remover tool: https://github.com/visible-cx/databroker_remover

### Want to get involved?

We'd love to hear from you, if it's an idea for the tool, or you want to submit a PR to a public project just get in touch!
